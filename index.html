<!-- ================= INTRODUCTION ================= -->

<section>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="card">
<p>
The evolution of anesthesia represents one of the most transformative advances in modern medicine. By enabling pain-free surgery and complex interventions, anesthetic practice has dramatically improved survival and surgical outcomes. As perioperative mortality has declined, attention has increasingly shifted toward outcomes that matter beyond the operating room, including functional recovery, quality of life, and long-term cognitive health.
</p>

<p>
Cognitive impairment following anesthesia and surgery has emerged as a major concern, particularly in older adults and vulnerable populations. These disturbances may range from transient confusion in the immediate postoperative period to more subtle deficits in memory, attention, and executive function that persist for weeks or months. Although often underrecognized, such changes can significantly affect independence, rehabilitation, and societal reintegration.
</p>

<p>
Historically, postoperative cognitive changes were frequently attributed to aging, comorbid illness, or the stress of hospitalization. However, systematic research over the last four decades has demonstrated that cognitive decline after surgery is neither rare nor trivial. This recognition has led to the development of standardized terminology, most notably the concept of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), which integrates delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction into a unified framework.
</p>

<p>
This review provides a comprehensive, student-oriented, and clinically rigorous overview of anesthesia-related cognitive impairment. Emphasis is placed on mechanisms, clinical evidence, risk stratification, prevention strategies, and future directions, with careful attention to ethical considerations and balanced interpretation of the literature.

<!-- ================= COGNITION ================= -->

<section>
<h2>2. Cognition: A Student-Oriented Primer</h2>
<div class="card">
<p>
Cognition refers to the ensemble of mental processes that allow individuals to acquire, process, store, and utilize information. Although often discussed as a single construct, cognition comprises multiple interdependent domains supported by distributed neural networks.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Memory</strong> includes encoding, consolidation, storage, and retrieval. Declarative memory relies on medial temporal lobe structures, whereas working memory is mediated primarily by prefrontal cortical circuits.</li>
<li><strong>Attention</strong> enables selective focus and sustained mental effort, involving frontoparietal networks and subcortical arousal systems.</li>
<li><strong>Executive function</strong> encompasses planning, decision-making, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control.</li>
<li><strong>Processing speed</strong> reflects the efficiency of information transfer across neural networks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Disruption in one or more of these domains may result in clinically detectable cognitive impairment. Importantly, subtle deficits—particularly in executive function or attention—may not be apparent in routine clinical interactions but can substantially impair daily functioning.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<!-- ================= TERMINOLOGY ================= -->

<section>
<h2>3. Terminology: POD, POCD, and PND</h2>
<div class="card">
<p>
Inconsistency in terminology historically hampered research and clinical communication regarding postoperative cognitive changes. To address this, expert consensus groups proposed standardized definitions under the umbrella term <strong>perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND)</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Postoperative Delirium (POD)</strong>: An acute, fluctuating disturbance of attention and awareness occurring typically within days of surgery.</li>
<li><strong>Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD)</strong>: A more subtle decline in cognitive performance detected weeks to months after surgery using neuropsychological testing.</li>
<li><strong>PND</strong>: Encompasses preoperative cognitive impairment, postoperative delirium, delayed neurocognitive recovery, and POCD.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This framework aligns perioperative cognitive disorders with diagnostic principles used in other neurocognitive conditions, facilitating research comparability and clinical recognition.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<!-- ================= EPIDEMIOLOGY ================= -->

<section>
<h2>4. Epidemiology and Clinical Burden</h2>
<div class="card">
<p>
The incidence of postoperative delirium ranges from 10% to over 50%, depending on patient age, surgical type, and assessment method. POCD has been reported in approximately 10–30% of older adults at three months following major non-cardiac surgery.
</p>

<p>
Cognitive impairment after surgery is associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased healthcare costs, delayed rehabilitation, and higher long-term mortality. From a societal perspective, these outcomes contribute substantially to caregiver burden and healthcare resource utilization.
</p>

<p>
Despite its prevalence and impact, perioperative cognitive impairment remains underdiagnosed, in part due to limited routine cognitive assessment and variability in diagnostic criteria.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<!-- ================= PATHOPHYSIOLOGY ================= -->

<section>
<h2>5. Pathophysiological Mechanisms</h2>
<div class="card">

<h3>Neuroinflammation</h3>
<p>
Surgical trauma induces a systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of cytokines such as interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. These mediators may access the central nervous system through disrupted blood–brain barrier integrity or via neural pathways, activating microglia and impairing synaptic function.
</p>

<h3>Blood–Brain Barrier Dysfunction</h3>
<p>
Age-related endothelial vulnerability may exacerbate blood–brain barrier permeability, amplifying neuroinflammatory cascades and neuronal injury.
</p>

<h3>Amyloid and Tau Hypotheses</h3>
<p>
Experimental studies suggest that volatile anesthetics may promote amyloid-β oligomerization and tau phosphorylation. However, translation of these findings to clinically meaningful neurodegeneration in humans remains controversial.
</p>

<h3>Neurotransmitter Dysregulation</h3>
<p>
Alterations in cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic signaling disrupt cortical connectivity and attentional networks, contributing to delirium and cognitive dysfunction.
</p>

<!-- ================= ANESTHETIC AGENTS ================= -->

<section>
<h2>6. Role of Anesthetic Agents</h2>
<div class="card">
<p>
Different anesthetic agents exert distinct molecular and network-level effects on the brain:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Volatile anesthetics</strong> (sevoflurane, isoflurane) have been linked to neuroinflammatory responses in preclinical models.</li>
<li><strong>Propofol</strong> is associated with rapid cognitive recovery and potential anti-inflammatory effects.</li>
<li><strong>Ketamine</strong> exhibits complex dose-dependent cognitive effects mediated by NMDA receptor antagonism.</li>
<li><strong>Dexmedetomidine</strong> may reduce delirium through sedative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Depth-of-anesthesia monitoring using EEG-derived indices has been associated with reduced delirium incidence, underscoring the importance of individualized anesthetic dosing.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<!-- ================= RISK FACTORS ================= -->

<section>
<h2>7. Risk Factors</h2>
<div class="card">
<ul>
<li>Advanced age</li>
<li>Low educational attainment and reduced cognitive reserve</li>
<li>Pre-existing cognitive impairment</li>
<li>Frailty and multimorbidity</li>
<li>Prolonged or complex surgery</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>

<!-- ================= PEDIATRIC & GERIATRIC ================= -->

<section>
<h2>8. Pediatric and Geriatric Considerations</h2>
<div class="card">
<p>
In pediatric populations, concerns focus on neurodevelopmental vulnerability during synaptogenesis. Human studies remain largely reassuring, emphasizing the importance of avoiding unnecessary fear.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the aging brain exhibits diminished neuroplasticity and heightened inflammatory sensitivity, rendering older adults particularly susceptible to perioperative cognitive disorders.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<!-- ================= ASSESSMENT ================= -->

<section>
<h2>9. Cognitive Assessment Tools</h2>
<div class="card">
<ul>
<li>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</li>
<li>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</li>
<li>Comprehensive neuropsychological batteries</li>
</ul>

<p>
While screening tools are practical, they may lack sensitivity for subtle deficits, highlighting the need for context-specific assessment strategies.
</p>
</div>
</section>
